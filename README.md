# Angular Panel

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.3, Bootstrap and FontAwesome Icons.
Also, it is an architecture proposal with a simple login flow with Amgular AuthGuard, lazy loading, and routing.

## The folder architecture 
```
- app
-- guards
-- modules
  |-- admin
    |--- components
-- services
-- components
  |-- login
  |-- forgot-password
  |-- not-found
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
